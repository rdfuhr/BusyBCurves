    <title>Help With Exploring Spline Curves</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>
    This <a href="BusyBCurves.html">interactive web app</a> enables you to explore the relationship between
    the following objects that are related to a curve <i>C</i> that can either be a <b>Bezier</b> curve or a <b>spline</b> curve.
    <ul>
        <li>The <b>control points</b> <i>P[i]</i></li>
        <li>The <b>parameter value</b> <i>t</i></li>
        <li>The <b>blending functions</b> <i>b[i](t)</i> (<b>Bernstein polynomials</b> or <b>B-splines</b>)</li>
        <li>The <b>point on the curve</b> <i>C(t) = sum{P[i]*b[i](t)}</i>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
This part of the program enables you to explore some properties of cubic
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spline_(mathematics)"><i>spline curves</i></a>.
</p>
<p>

curves click <a href="BezierHelp.html">here</a>
</p>
<p>
A <i>spline curve</i> (as shown in this app) is a <i>parametric curve</i> C(t) = (x(t), y(t)), where x(t) and y(t) are each real-valued <i>spline functions</i>.  
</p>
<p>
A <i>spline function</i> is made up of pieces, each of which can be represented by a <i>polynomial</i>.  The pieces typically join together smoothly.
</p>
<p>
In this app, each polynomial is of degree three. 
</p>
<p> 
On the graph of the red spline
curve you will see little black rectangles.  These represent locations where we switch
from one (x(t), y(t)) pair of polynomials to the next.  
The parameter values associated with these locations are called <i>knots</i>.
</p>
</p>
<p>
The yellow circle on the red cubic spline curve is <b>always</b> at the
<i>center of mass</i> of the blue <i>control points</i>, where the mass of each control point is equal to the area of the blue circle.
</p>
<p>
The number next to this yellow circle (the <i>parameter</i>) varies between 0 and 1.
</p>
<p>
As this number varies, the yellow circle moves along the red curve,
and the blue control points increase or decrease in area, with at most four of the control points having some blue for any parameter.
</p>
<p>
The areas of the four blue circles <b>always</b> add up to 1.
</p>

<p>
These areas are equal to the <i>values of the functions</i> whose green graphs
are drawn next to the blue circles.
</p>
<p>
These functions are called
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-spline"><i>B-splines</i></a>.
</p>
<p>
The black polyline connecting the blue control points is the <i>control polygon</i> for the spline
curve.  NOTE: The spline curve is <i>always tangent</i> to its control polygon at the endpoints,
no matter how you move the control points.
</p>
<p>
Finally, the brown lines connecting the small orange circles illustrate
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Boor%27s_algorithm"><i>de Boor's algorithm</i></a>
for evaluating a point on the spline curve at a particular parameter value. 
<br>If you select the box labeled
<i>Skeleton</i>, you will see <b>only</b> the details of de Boor's algorithm.
<br>
Starting with only those edges
of the control polygon for which the end points are participating, an orange circle is placed along that edge at a position determined by the
current parameter value according to a somewhat complex formula.
<br>
Then new edges are created connecting successive orange circles, and the
process is repeated, creating new orange circles and brown edges, until we finally arrive at the point on the curve.

Press the <b>Start Animation</b> button to start the animation.
</p>
<p>
Press the <b>Stop Animation</b> button to stop the animation.
</p>
<p>
At any time, you can also do your own exploration as follows:
<ul>
<li>
You can click on any control-point circle and drag it around
to change the shape of the curve.  The <i>parametric</i> position of the
yellow circle will <b>not</b> change.
</li>
<li>
You can click on the yellow circle and drag it along the curve
and watch the areas of the blue circles change accordingly.
The <i>locations</i> of the centers of the blue circles will <b>not</b> change.
</li>
<li>
In most browsers you can grab the slider <i>Parameter Range</i> near the bottom and move it to make the yellow circle move.
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
You can switch from Spline to Bezier by clicking the radio button next to <i>Curve Type</i>, and you can get help with exploring Bezier
curves <a href="BezierHelp.html">here</a>.

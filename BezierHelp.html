    <title>Help With Exploring Bezier Curves</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>
    This <a href="BusyBCurves.html">interactive web app</a> enables you to explore the relationship between
    the following objects that are related to a curve <i>C</i> that can either be a <b>Bezier</b> curve or a <b>spline</b> curve.
    <ul>
        <li>The <b>control points</b> <i>P[i]</i></li>
        <li>The <b>parameter value</b> <i>t</i></li>
        <li>The <b>blending functions</b> <i>b[i](t)</i> (<b>Bernstein polynomials</b> or <b>B-splines</b>)</li>
        <li>The <b>point on the curve</b> <i>C(t) = sum{P[i]*b[i](t)}</i>
    </ul>
</p>    
<p>
This part of the program enables you to explore some properties of cubic
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zier_curve"><i>Bezier curves</i></a>.
</p>
<p>
To get help with exploring spline
curves click <a href="SplineHelp.html">here</a>
</p>
<p>
A <i>Bezier curve</i> (as shown in this app) is a <i>parametric curve</i> C(t) = (x(t), y(t)), where x(t) and y(t) are each real-valued <i>polynomials</i>.  
</p>
<p>
What distinguishes a Bezier curve from the better-known form (where polynomials are expressed in the form a + bt + ct^2 + dt^3) is that we express Bezier curves in terms of <i>control points</i> and <i>Bernstein polynomials</i>.
</p>
<p>
The yellow circle on the red cubic Bezier curve is <b>always</b> at the
<i>center of mass</i> of the blue <i>control points</i>, where the mass of each control point is equal to the area of the blue circle.
</p>
<p>
The number next to this yellow circle (the <i>parameter</i>) varies between 0 and 1.
</p>
<p>
As this number varies, the yellow circle moves along the red curve,
and the blue control points increase or decrease in area.
</p>
<p>
The areas of the four blue circles <b>always</b> add up to 1.  NOTE: In this demo, the areas of
the circles are rounded to two decimal places, so there can be cases where the sum of
these <i>rounded</i> areas does not equal 1.
</p>
<p>
The number near each blue circle is the <i>area</i> of that circle.
</p>
<p>
These areas are equal to the <i>values of the functions</i> whose green graphs
are drawn next to the blue circles.
</p>
<p>
These functions are called
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernstein_polynomials"><i>Bernstein basis polynomials</i></a>.
</p>
<p>
The black polyline connecting the blue control points is the <i>control polygon</i> for the Bezier
curve.  NOTE: The Bezier curve is <i>always tangent</i> to its control polygon at the endpoints,
no matter how you move the control points.
</p>
<p>
Finally, the brown lines connecting the small orange circles illustrate
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Casteljau%27s_algorithm"><i>DeCasteljau's algorithm</i></a>
for evaluating a point on the Bezier curve at a particular parameter value.  
<br>If you select the box labeled
<i>Skeleton</i>, you will see <b>only</b> the details of DeCasteljau's algorithm.
<br>
Starting with each edge
of the control polygon, an orange circle is placed along that edge at a position determined by the
current parameter value.
<br>
For instance, if the current parameter value is 0.38, then each new orange circle is placed
38% of the way along that edge.
<br>
Then new edges are created connecing successive orange circles, and the
process is repeated, creating new orange circles and brown edges, until we finally arrive at the point on the curve.

Press the <b>Start Animation</b> button to start the animation.
</p>
<p>
Press the <b>Stop Animation</b> button to stop the animation.
</p>
<p>
At any time, you can also do your own exploration as follows:
<ul>
<li>
You can click on any control-point circle and drag it around
to change the shape of the curve.  The <i>parametric</i> position of the
yellow circle will <b>not</b> change.
</li>
<li>
You can click on the yellow circle and drag it along the curve
and watch the areas of the blue circles change accordingly.
The <i>locations</i> of the centers of the blue circles will <b>not</b> change.
</li>
<li>
In most browsers you can grab the slider labeled <i>Parameter Range</i> near the bottom and move it to make the yellow circle move.
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
You can switch from Bezier to Spline by clicking the radio button next to <i>Curve Type</i>, and you can get help with exploring spline
curves <a href="SplineHelp.html">here</a>.

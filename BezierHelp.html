    <title>Help With Exploring Bezier Curves</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>
This program enables you to explore some properties of cubic
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zier_curve"><i>Bezier curves</i></a>.
</p>
<p>
The yellow circle on the red cubic Bezier curve is <b>always</b> at the
<i>center of mass</i> of the blue <i>control points</i>.
</p>
<p>
The number next to this yellow circle (the <i>parameter</i>) varies between 0 and 1.
</p>
<p>
As this number varies, the yellow circle moves along the red curve,
and the blue control points increase or decrease in area.
</p>
<p>
The areas of the four blue circles <b>always</b> add up to 1.  (NOTE: In this demo, the areas of
the circles are rounded to two decimal places, so there can be cases where the sum of
these <i>rounded</i> areas does not equal 1.)
</p>
<p>
The number near each blue circle is the <i>area</i> of that circle.
</p>
<p>
These areas are equal to the <i>values of the functions</i> whose green graphs
are drawn next to the blue circles.
</p>
<p>
These functions are called
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernstein_polynomials"><i>Bernstein basis polynomials</i></a>.
</p>
<p>
The black polyline connecting the blue control points is the <i>control polygon</i> for the Bezier
curve.  (NOTE: The Bezier curve is <i>always tangent</i> to its control polygon at the endpoints,
no matter how you move the control points.)
</p>
<p>
Finally, the brown lines connecting the small orange circles illustrate
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Casteljau%27s_algorithm"><i>DeCasteljau's algorithm</i></a>
for evaluating a point on the Bezier curve at a particular parameter value.
<br>
Starting with each edge
of the control polygon, an orange circle is placed along that edge at a position determined by the
current parameter value.
<br>
For instance, if the current parameter value is 0.38, then each new orange circle is placed
38% of the way along that edge.
<br>
Then new edges are created connecing successive orange circles, and the
process is repeated, creating new orange circles and brown edges, until we finally arrive at the point on the curve.

<li>
You can click on any blue circle and drag it around
to change the shape of the curve.  The <i>parametric</i> position of the
yellow circle will <b>not</b> change.
</li>
<li>
You can click on the yellow circle and drag it along the curve
and watch the areas of the blue circles change accordingly.
The <i>locations</i> of the centers of the blue circles will <b>not</b> change.
</li>
<li>
In most browsers you can grab the slider labeled <i>Parameter Range</i> near the bottom and move it to make the yellow circle move.
</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
You can switch from Bezier to Spline by clicking the radio button next to <i>Curve Type</i>, and you can get help with exploring Spline
curves <a href="SplineHelp.html">here</a>

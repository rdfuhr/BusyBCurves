                            Bernstein polynomials form a basis for linear spaces of polynomials.

                            B-splines form a basis for linear spaces of splines.

                            A cubic spline curve can be constructed that passes through specified
                            points and has specified start and end conditions.  
                            To do this, you set up and solve a system of linear equations.  The 
                            resulting matrix is tridiagonal.

                            A space of splines is determined by specifying:
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    the degree of all the polynomial components of each spline in the space
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    a set of breakpoints at which the polynomial components join up
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    the levels of derivative continuity required at each breakpoint
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                            The tangent line at the start of a Bezier or spline curve is the
                            line between its first and second control point. A similar property
                            holds for the tangent line at the end of the curve.

                            A powerful dual-basis formula for splines, developed by C. de Boor and G. Fix, makes
                            use of derivative values for the splines.

                            The shape of a Bezier or spline curve is governed by the location of
                            the control points.  This is demonstrated in the interactive web
                            app <a href="https://richardfuhr.neocities.org/BusyBCurves.html">Exploring Bezier and Spline Curves</a>.

                        <li>
                            Evaluation algorithms for Bezier and spline curves have geometric
                            interpretations, which are also demonstrated in the
                            <a href="https://richardfuhr.neocities.org/BusyBCurves.html">interactive web app</a>.

                            Bezier and spline curves are contained within the convex hull of their control points.
                            For a spline curve a stricter result is true; each span of a spline curve is contained
                            within the convex hull of a particular set of degree + 1 control points.

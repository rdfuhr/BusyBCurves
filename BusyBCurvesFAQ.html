            Q: What is the purpose of this app?
            <br>
            A:     This <a href="BusyBCurves.html">interactive web app</a> enables you to explore the relationship between
            the following objects that are related to a curve <i>C</i> that can either be a <b>Bezier</b> curve or a <b>spline</b> curve.
            <ul>
                <li>The <b>control points</b> <i>P[i]</i></li>
                <li>The <b>parameter value</b> <i>t</i></li>
                <li>The <b>blending functions</b> <i>b[i](t)</i> (<b>Bernstein polynomials</b> or <b>B-spline basis functions</b>)</li>
                <li>The <b>point on the curve</b> <i>C(t) = sum{P[i]*b[i](t)}</i>
             </ul>
                <br>

            <li>
                Q: What programming language was used to develop this app?
                <br>
                A: <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org">TypeScript</a>
                <br>

            <li>
                Q: How is the cubic Bezier curve drawn?
                <br>
                A: The cubic Bezier curve is drawn using the bezierCurveTo method of the CanvasRenderingContext2D object, which is obtained from the HTML5 Canvas.
                <br>
                <br>
            </li>
            <li>
                Q: How is the cubic spline curve drawn?
                <br>
                A: The cubic spline curve is drawn by first internally representing it as a piecewise Bezier curve and then using the bezierCurveTo method.  The
                   piecewise-Bezier curve representation is obtained by knot insertion so that each distinct knot has multiplicity equal to the degree.

            <li>
                Q: How are the graphs of the Bernstein polynomials drawn?
                <br>
                A: The graph of each Bernstein polynomial b[i](t) is represented as a cubic Bezier curve (t, b[i](t)) by determining the appropriate control points, and
                   that Bezier curve is drawn as described above.

            <li>
                Q: How are the graphs of the B-Spline basis functions drawn?
                <br>
                A: The graph of each B-spline basis function b[i](t) is represented as a cubic spline curve (t, b[i](t)) by determining the appropriate control points, and
                   that cubic spline curve is drawn as described above.

                Q: If I have more questions or comments, how do I contact the developer?
                <br>
                A: Please send your questions or comments to the software developer at
                <a href="mailto:richard.fuhr@gmail.com">richard.fuhr@gmail.com</a>.

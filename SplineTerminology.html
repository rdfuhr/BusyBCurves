        Some Spline Terminology
    </h1>
    <p>
        The purpose of these notes is to briefly discuss some of the terminology 
        related to the spline portion of the interactive web app 
        <a href="BusyBCurves.html">Exploring Bezier and Spline Curves</a>, together with
        the associated <a href="SplineHelp.html"> help page</a> and its links.
    </p>
    <p>  
        We recognize that, as the technology has evolved, the usage of these terms 
        does vary among authors when used in software and in technical publications.
    </p>
    <p>
        We will describe our use of the terms and also will point out some alternative
        usages below. We will not try to be totally mathematically rigorous or complete.  
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Spline function: We consider a spline function to be a real-valued piecewise
            polynomial having specified degree, specified set of breakpoints, and 
            specified level of derivative continuity at each breakpoint. 
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            B-spline: We consider a B-spline to be a normalized spline function that has
            minimal support with regard to specified degree, specified set of breakpoints, and 
            specified level of derivative continuity at each breakpoint.
            The graphs of some B-spline functions are displayed next to the corresponding
            control points in the  
            spline portion of the <a href="BusyBCurves.html">interactive web app</a>.  
            Every spline function can be written uniquely as a linear combination of appropriately-chosen
            B-spline functions.  The "B" in "B-spline" stands for "basis," so it is often considered
            better style to refer simply to "B-splines" rather than "B-spline basis functions."
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Spline curve:  In our web app a spline curve is a two-dimensional parametric curve of the
            form C(t) = (x(t), y(t)), where x(t) and y(t) are each real-valued spline functions.
            Some people call a spline curve a B-spline curve, whenever the x and y components of the spline
            curve are explicitly represented as linear combinations of B-splines.  However, in our work
            we reserve the use of the term B-spline for the basis functions themselves and not for functions
            or curves that are expressed as linear combinations of these basis functions.
